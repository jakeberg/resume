Assessment details:


## Maestro Study Orchestration(2024-Present):

For the Maestro Study Orchestration project, I took on a lead role to ensure critical business requirements were met for an application that helps Clinical Trial Coordinators track and update patient activities within trials. I designed and implemented Temporal Workflows to fetch data from external databases, using a plug-in architecture for better scalability and flexibility. My work on DynamoDB involved complex data structures, managed through GraphQL and coordinated with the Saga Pattern for robust, multi-table updates. Additionally, I set up an audit log system with Kinesis Streams to track all entity updates, which strengthened our system’s traceability and monitoring capabilities.

Recently, I initiated work on a new business rule management system using React Flow. This solution, currently in the research phase with the product owner, aims to empower non-technical users to configure site-specific rules within the application, making the system adaptable, user-centric and scalable. This expansion has the potential to scale the project significantly, as it could lead to a larger team in future project phases. Through these efforts, I’ve actively contributed to enhancing both the application’s functionality and its potential for broader business impact.


## LillyDev SRE Responsibilities & IMS (Inventory Management System)(2021-2024):

As a Senior Site Reliability Engineer, I oversaw various shared services within Lilly’s DevOps community, such as the LillyDev React site and migration tools on ECS. My role involved setting up infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, monitoring performance, and implementing scalable solutions.

One of the major projects I took part in as an SRE was the IMS project. In this project, I led the development of microservices and SPAs that provided visibility into SASS products being used across the enterprise. This event-driven architecture used SNS, SQS, and Lambda functions to automate notifications and update statuses, improving data integrity. The project required rigorous database design and optimization skills, which I applied to manage lifecycle states and automate ownership processes. I collaborated closely with product owners and UX, deploying with GitHub Actions and using CloudFormation to maintain clean, scalable code.  In leading this effort, I was responsible for reducing the overall enterprise footprint by over 20% on Heroku and 25% on Contentful. By employing best practices and collaboration with the client, I built a framework that simplified operations and reduced resource usage.


## eCTS (Enterprise Clinical Trial System)(2020 - 2021):

As a senior engineer on the eCTS project, I contributed to modernizing a legacy clinical trial management system with TypeScript, AWS Lambdas, and API Gateway. This involved designing microservices and serverless architectures that minimized dependencies on older systems. My work extended to maintaining an agile development flow, ensuring we met strict business and compliance requirements. This experience deepened my understanding of event-driven architectures and cloud-native development while allowing me to directly support the scalability and performance goals of the organization.


## Data Marketplace(2019 - 2020):

The Data Marketplace project required agile, flexible UI development, and I worked directly with product owners and UX to rapidly iterate on prototypes that aligned with evolving business goals. I used AWS CloudFront, CodePipeline, and CloudFormation to deploy a responsive React frontend, establishing a CI/CD pipeline for smooth releases. This project helped me hone my skills in requirements analysis and design patterns, focusing on delivering a product that was adaptable, efficient.


## Lilly Trial Guide(2018 - 2019):

I helped in the developent of a major overhaul of a public-facing application, moving it from React/Sails to a Next.js/Express stack. We worked closely with product owners and UX for agile iterations with strict adherence to company guidelines. I helped implement scalable solutions, including deploying to Heroku and integrating with Contentful and Elastic Search, making the app easily configurable and efficient. I assisted in streamlining deployment with CI/CD, ensuring a reliable, maintainable product that met Lilly’s high standards for accessibility and multilingual support.
